======

Launch an unelevated Windows process from an elevated Windows process.

Code is from http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/18/10468726.aspx,
but that blog post requires you follow a bunch of links to track down the referenced
code and build a project on your own.

Please note: I am not a remotely experienced Windows developer; this code may be
horrendously buggy and I wouldn't know it (it definitely doesn't have much
error checking, by design).  Please send any questions to Raymond Chen, not me.
